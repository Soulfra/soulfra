    You know what I really hate? The cringe on social media. Everyone's trying so hard to be
    authentic but it all feels so fake. I want genuine connection, real community, people being
    vulnerable and honest. That's the only way to build trust and belonging. The whole validation
    game is broken. We need spaces where people can express their true identity without fear.
    Social acceptance shouldn't be based on performance. It's about being real, being yourself,
    finding your truth. That's what authentic social interaction looks like.
