# ⭐ Star Economy Design - GitHub as Currency

## Your Vision

> "github has stars and other things too. we can just build a game based on anything too. reminds me of minecraft or roblox or their currencies or osrs gold or the rares in rs3 or d2jsp"

**Exactly!** GitHub stars → game currency, just like:
- OSRS gold (buy/sell items)
- D2JSP forum gold (trade items)
- Minecraft diamonds (unlock features)
- Roblox Robux (buy premium)

## The Game Mechanic

### What Are Stars?

**In normal GitHub:**
- Star a repo = bookmark it
- Stars = popularity metric
- No real value

**In Soulfra Network:**
- Stars = **currency**
- Stars = **progression**
- Stars = **access control**
- Stars = **marketplace credits**

### How Stars Work

```
User stars Soulfra repos → Earn stars in account
Stars unlock domains      → Tier progression
Stars can be spent        → Marketplace transactions
Stars regenerate          → Daily login bonus
```

| Unlock Tier 2 | 15 stars | howtocookathome |
| Unlock Tier 3 | 30 stars | cringeproof |

**Note:** Tiers are CUMULATIVE. You don't spend stars to unlock, you just need to have earned that many total.

### Marketplace Transactions (Spend Stars)

| Action | Cost | Cooldown |
|--------|------|----------|
| List an item | 10 stars | None |
| Feature listing (top of page) | 25 stars | 7 days |

| Premium API rate limit | 10 stars | 30 days | 10x requests/hour |

## Marketplace Economy

Like D2JSP forum gold or OSRS Grand Exchange!

### How It Works

1. **List Item:**
   - Pay 10 stars to create listing
   - Set price in stars
   - Item appears in marketplace

2. **Browse Marketplace:**
   - Filter by category
   - Sort by price (stars)
   - See seller reputation

3. **Buy Item:**
   - Pay seller's asking price
   - Stars transfer from buyer → seller
   - 5% platform fee

4. **Get Item:**
   - Digital: Instant delivery
   - Physical: Escrow until confirmed
   - Service: Milestone-based payment

### Example Listings

| Item | Seller | Price | Description |
|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Custom QR code design | alice | 50 stars | Professional QR with logo |
| Recipe ebook | bob | 25 stars | 100 recipes PDF |
| Code review (1 hour) | charlie | 75 stars | Expert code audit |
| Domain name idea | dave | 10 stars | Brandable .com name |
| Premium template | eve | 100 stars | Website template |

### Seller Reputation

**Like eBay feedback:**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 stars) = Trusted seller
- Number of sales: 50+
- Response time: < 1 hour
- Completion rate: 98%

**Bonuses for high reputation:**
- Tier 5 sellers (100+ sales): 0% platform fee
- Featured in "Top Sellers" section
- Blue checkmark badge

## Star Regeneration (Daily Login Bonus)

Like Daily Challenges in games!

### Streak System

```
Day 1:  +1 star
Day 2:  +1 star
Day 3:  +2 stars
Day 4:  +2 stars
Day 5:  +3 stars
Day 6:  +3 stars
Day 7:  +5 stars (bonus!)
Total:  +17 stars for 7-day streak
```

**Break the streak?**
- Resets to Day 1
- But you don't lose earned stars!

## Anti-Abuse Mechanisms

### Prevent Star Farming

**GitHub API Detection:**
- Track when repos were starred
- Detect mass-starring (100+ in 1 hour)
- Require account age > 7 days
- Verify real GitHub accounts (not bots)

**Cooldowns:**
- 1 star per repo (can't unstar/restar)
- Daily limits on certain actions
- Referral limits (max 10 friends/day)

**Quality Controls:**
- Blog posts reviewed before awarding stars
- Bug reports must be valid
- QR verifications checked for duplicates

### Prevent Marketplace Abuse

**Escrow System:**
- Physical goods held until delivered
- Digital goods watermarked
- Services paid per milestone

**Dispute Resolution:**
- Buyer can open dispute within 7 days
- Seller must respond within 24 hours
- Platform mediates if needed

**Banned Actions:**
- Selling stars for real money (outside platform)
- Star gifting to bypass tiers
- Fake listings

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

```sql
-- User stars table
CREATE TABLE user_stars (
    user_id INTEGER,
    github_username TEXT,
    total_stars_earned INTEGER,  -- Lifetime total
    current_stars INTEGER,         -- Spendable balance
    tier INTEGER,                  -- 0-4
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    last_login TIMESTAMP
);

-- Star transactions
CREATE TABLE star_transactions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    amount INTEGER,               -- +/- stars
    type TEXT,                     -- 'earn', 'spend', 'transfer'
    source TEXT,                   -- 'github_star', 'daily_login', 'marketplace'
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Marketplace listings
CREATE TABLE marketplace_listings (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    seller_id INTEGER,
    title TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    price_stars INTEGER,
    category TEXT,
    status TEXT,                   -- 'active', 'sold', 'removed'
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Marketplace purchases
CREATE TABLE marketplace_purchases (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    listing_id INTEGER,
    buyer_id INTEGER,
    seller_id INTEGER,
    price_stars INTEGER,
    platform_fee_stars INTEGER,
    status TEXT,                   -- 'pending', 'completed', 'disputed'
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### GitHub API Integration

**Check user's stars:**
```python
import requests

def get_user_stars(github_username):
    """Get total stars user has given to Soulfra repos"""
    url = f"https://api.github.com/users/{github_username}/starred"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}"}

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    starred_repos = response.json()

    # Count only Soulfra org repos
    soulfra_stars = [
        repo for repo in starred_repos
        if repo['owner']['login'] == 'Soulfra'
    ]

    return len(soulfra_stars)
```

**Calculate tier:**
```python
def calculate_tier(total_stars_earned):
    """Determine user's tier based on lifetime stars"""
    if total_stars_earned >= 50:
        return 4  # Elite
    elif total_stars_earned >= 30:
        return 3  # Advanced
    elif total_stars_earned >= 15:
        return 2  # Creative
    elif total_stars_earned >= 5:
        return 1  # Foundation
    else:
        return 0  # Free
```

**Daily login bonus:**
```python
def award_daily_login(user_id):
    """Give stars for daily login, track streak"""
    user = get_user(user_id)
    last_login = user['last_login']

    # Check if last login was yesterday
    if is_yesterday(last_login):
        # Continue streak
        user['streak_days'] += 1
    elif is_today(last_login):
        # Already logged in today
        return 0
    else:
        # Streak broken
        user['streak_days'] = 1

    # Calculate bonus
    if user['streak_days'] == 7:
        stars = 5  # Bonus!
        user['streak_days'] = 0  # Reset for next week
    elif user['streak_days'] >= 5:
        stars = 3
    elif user['streak_days'] >= 3:
        stars = 2
    else:
        stars = 1

    # Award stars
    add_stars(user_id, stars, source='daily_login')
    update_user(user_id, last_login=now(), streak_days=user['streak_days'])

    return stars
```

## Why This Works

### Answers Your Questions

1. **"like osrs gold or the rares in rs3 or d2jsp"**
   → Stars function exactly like forum gold or GP

2. **"you can only accept something if someone buys it"**
   → Marketplace requires stars to purchase

3. **"github has stars and other things too"**
   → We gamify the existing star system

4. **"we can just build a game based on anything"**
   → Star economy = game progression
