## Example Session

"Hey Siri, create content"

[Start rambling]

"I'm so sick of typing. I see all these programmers and DJs and
content creators talking on their AirPods while they're out walking
or whatever. Why can't we just code that way? Like, I have ideas
all the time when I'm away from my computer. Voice memos are great
but then I have to transcribe them and organize them. What if the
AI just did all that? Built the Flask route from my voice description.
Wrote the blog post from my rambling. Created the social media posts.
That's the future..."

[5 minutes later]

"Content Ready - Blog post in clipboard, all formats in Notes"

A: Add more personality to your rambling. AI mimics your tone.
