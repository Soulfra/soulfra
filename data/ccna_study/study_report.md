### Framework

- **OSI Model**: 7-layer model for network communication

### Topology

- **Star Topology**: All nodes connect to central hub
- **Mesh Topology**: Every node connects to every other node

### Protocol

- **TCP**: Reliable, connection-oriented protocol
- **UDP**: Unreliable, connectionless protocol for speed
- **IP**: Internet Protocol for addressing and routing
- **NAT**: Network Address Translation - private to public IP mapping
- **OSPF**: Open Shortest Path First - link-state routing protocol

### Concept

- **Subnetting**: Dividing network into smaller subnetworks
- **CIDR**: Classless Inter-Domain Routing notation

### Security

- **ACL**: Access Control List - firewall rules
- **VLAN**: Virtual LAN - logical network segmentation

## Study Tips

1. Review concept graph daily
2. Practice flashcards using spaced repetition
3. Map new concepts to topology diagram
4. Connect networking concepts to your domain architecture
