You open your eyes.

The room is white. Completely white. Walls, floor, ceiling — all the same sterile brightness.

A voice speaks. It's neither male nor female, neither human nor machine:

**"You volunteered for this."**

But you don't remember volunteering.

You don't remember your name.

You don't remember how you got here.

The voice continues: **"The Soulfra Experiment begins now. You will answer seven questions. Based on your answers, we will determine if you are conscious... or simply programmed to believe you are."**

A screen appears on the white wall. The first question waits.

But before you can read it, you notice something:

*There's a mirror to your left. And the person staring back... you're not entirely sure it's you.*

**THE OBSERVER IS WATCHING.**
