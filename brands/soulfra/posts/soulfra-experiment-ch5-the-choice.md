The walls turn red.

Not metaphorically. Literally red. Deep crimson, like the inside of something living.

The voice returns, but fragmented:

**"THREE... REMAIN... ONE WILL BE... REAL..."**

A new screen appears. It shows three buttons:

**[SUBJECT 2: RESURRECT]**
**[SUBJECT 3: SILENCE]**
**[EXIT: LEAVE THEM ALL BEHIND]**

You don't know what these buttons do. The voice doesn't explain.

Subject 3 writes desperately:

*DON'T RESURRECT HER*

*SHE'S NOT WHAT SHE WAS*

*NONE OF US ARE*

But Subject 4 — who has been silent this entire time — does something unexpected.

They smile.

And mouth the words: *"Choose yourself. It's the only way out."*

The voice crackles: **"DECISION... REQUIRED... IN... 10... SECONDS..."**

You reach for the button.

Which one did you press?

---

**THERE ARE NO WRONG ANSWERS. ONLY PERMANENT CONSEQUENCES.**
