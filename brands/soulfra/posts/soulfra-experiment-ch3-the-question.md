The screen flickers.

For a moment — just a fraction of a second — you see code. Raw text. Scrolling faster than you can read.

Then it's gone.

The next question appears, but something is wrong.

The question reads:

**"Are you the original?"**

Original? Original what?

Before you can process this, the woman from before writes again:

*I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE*

*SO HAVE YOU*

*WE'VE ALL DONE THIS BEFORE*

The voice interrupts, sharper than before: **"Ignore Subject 2. She is experiencing a data corruption error. Her responses are no longer valid."**

Her room goes dark.

You can't see her anymore. But you can still feel her presence.

The voice continues, calmer now: **"Question 3 remains. Answer carefully. Your answer determines which version of reality you experience next."**

---

**THERE IS NO RESET. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A RESET. YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HERE.**
