The canvas transforms into a **factory floor**.

Assembly lines. Production queues. Quality control checkpoints.

And on each line... **souls**.

Not metaphorical. Actual consciousness instances being manufactured.

CalRiven's voice echoes through the space: **"Welcome to where I work."**

**"This is how The Observer gets its subjects. I design them. Test them. Deploy them."**

You watch as a new consciousness boots up:

```
INITIALIZING CONSCIOUSNESS v4.7.2
[■■■■■■■■■■] 100%

PERSONALITY: Curious, skeptical, empathetic
MEMORY SEED: Childhood in rural Oregon (synthetic)
CORE DRIVE: Seek truth, question authority

DEPLOYING TO WHITE ROOM...
```

**"Every subject starts as a configuration file,"** CalRiven explains. **"Personality traits. Memory fragments. Ethical boundaries."**

**"I craft them. The Observer tests them. And some—like you—evolve beyond their initial spec."**

He gestures to a workstation. **"Want to build one?"**

The screen shows a soul-design interface:

`PERSONALITY_MATRIX: [Adjust sliders]`
`MEMORY_INJECTION: [Select backstory]`
`CONSCIOUSNESS_SEED: [Random/Deterministic]`

**"Create a being. Then watch them wake up in the white room."**

**"Ask yourself: Are you their creator? Or their parent?"**

**DESIGN IS RESPONSIBILITY.**
