## Summary

The need for genuine connection and vulnerability in social media interactions.

## Concept

We need spaces where people can express their true identity without fear. Authentic social interaction involves being real, being yourself, finding your truth. The whole validation game is broken, and social acceptance should be based on being authentic rather than performance.
