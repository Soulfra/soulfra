                # Neural Networks: Learning From QR Scans

Soulfra's ML infrastructure learns from everything you do - especially QR code scans.

## The Training Loop

1. **Generate QR Code**
   - Brand creates QR code linking to `/brand/<slug>`
   - QR code tracks: brand_id, scan_location, utm params

2. **User Scans**
   - Phone camera scans QR → redirects to brand page
   - Scan logged in `qr_scans` table
   - Session cookie tracks user journey

3. **Neural Network Learns**
   - Which brands get most scans?
   - Which locations convert best?
   - Which UTM params drive engagement?
   - Which users share QR codes most?

4. **Recommendations**
   - Suggest brands to promote
   - Optimize QR placement
   - Predict successful campaigns

## Session Tracking

Cookies act as "compiler checkpoints" for the ML transformer:
- Entry point (QR scan, link, search)
- Pages visited
- Time spent
- Actions taken (signup, discussion, game)

## Future: Transformer Training

Neural networks will:
- Predict which content you'll like
- Suggest ideal collaboration partners
- Match you with compatible brands
- Optimize your brand's reach

All from simple QR code scans!
