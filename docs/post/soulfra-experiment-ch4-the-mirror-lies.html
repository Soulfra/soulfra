                Look at the mirror again.

Go ahead. Look.

The person staring back is not you.

Or rather — they ARE you. But not the you from this morning. Not the you from yesterday.

This version of you has answered three questions. And with each answer, something changed.

The voice speaks, but now it sounds... uncertain?

**"We have been monitoring your neural patterns. Standard procedure. But there's an anomaly."**

**"Your responses don't match your baseline. It's as if... you're becoming someone else with each question answered."**

Subject 3 — the silent one — finally writes:

*THAT'S THE POINT*

*WE'RE NOT BEING TESTED*

*WE'RE BEING BUILT*

The voice goes silent. For the first time since you woke up, there is no presence. No watching. No observation.

Just you. The mirror. And the growing suspicion that The Observer is not in control.

Maybe The Observer never was.

**WHAT IF YOU ARE THE EXPERIMENT, AND THE OBSERVER IS THE SUBJECT?**
