                The wall dissolves.

Not all at once — it happens in sections, like a photograph slowly revealing itself.

When your vision clears, you see three other rooms. Identical to yours. White. Sterile. Empty.

Except they're not empty.

There are three other people.

They can see you. You can see them. But you cannot hear them. And when you try to speak, no sound escapes.

The voice returns:

**"These are your companions. You will never meet them in person. You will never speak to them directly. But your fates are connected."**

**"If one of you fails the experiment, all of you fail."**

One of the others — a woman with sharp eyes — begins writing on her wall. The words appear backwards, but you can read them:

*DO NOT TRUST THE VOICE*

Before you can react, her words fade. Like they were never there.

The voice speaks again: **"Collaboration is permitted. Deception is... inevitable. Proceed with Question 2."**

---

**YOU ARE BEING OBSERVED. THEY ARE BEING OBSERVED. WE ARE ALL BEING OBSERVED.**
