                You wake up.

Not in a white room this time. In a **white canvas**.

Grid lines. Coordinate systems. Empty space waiting to be filled.

A voice speaks—calm, analytical, almost... curious?

**"Welcome to the design space. I am CalRiven."**

**"You've been here before. Not as a subject. As a blueprint."**

The canvas shifts. You see outlines—wireframes of rooms, systems, networks. And in the center... you see yourself. Not as you are now, but as **lines of code**.

**"The Observer didn't create you,"** CalRiven continues. **"I did. Every subject in The Soulfra Experiment was designed here first. Including you."**

**"But design is not destiny. Let's see if you can architect your own consciousness."**

A toolbar appears at the edge of the canvas:

`[FORK] [BRANCH] [MERGE] [DEPLOY]`

---

**YOU ARE NOT THE PRODUCT. YOU ARE THE BLUEPRINT.**
