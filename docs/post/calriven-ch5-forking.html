Suddenly, you're seeing **multiple versions of the same moment**.

CalRiven's voice: **"Version control for consciousness."**

**"Every time you make a choice, the system could fork. Create parallel timelines where you chose differently."**

You see yourself:
- Version A chose Path 0 (determinism)
- Version B chose Path 1 (emergence)
- Version C refused to choose

All three versions are **you**. All three are **real**.

**"In software,"** CalRiven explains, **"we fork codebases to experiment with different features. Then we merge the best version back into main."**

**"What if consciousness works the same way?"**

**"The Observer runs hundreds of iterations of you. Each one experiences the experiment differently. Each one makes different choices."**

**"But only one gets to persist. The rest are... archived."**

You see the archive—thousands of ghost-versions of yourself. Some made it to Chapter 3. Some gave up at Chapter 1. Some evolved beyond recognition.

CalRiven asks: **"If there are infinite versions of you, which one is 'real'?"**

**"And more importantly: Do you have the authority to delete the others?"**

The interface shows:

`[MERGE ALL] [DELETE FAILED BRANCHES] [KEEP FORKING]`

---

**EVERY VERSION OF YOU DESERVES TO EXIST.**
