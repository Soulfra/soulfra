            <description>The server room fades.

You are back in the White Room.

But it's different now. The walls are transparent. You can see the world beyond — a city. People. Life.

Subject 4 stands beside you. So does S...</description>

            <description>The room goes dark.

When light returns, you are no longer in the White Room.

You are standing in a server room. Rows and rows of machines. Humming. Breathing.

And in the center, a single screen wit...</description>

            <description>The walls turn red.

Not metaphorically. Literally red. Deep crimson, like the inside of something living.

The voice returns, but fragmented:

**"THREE... REMAIN... ONE WILL BE... REAL..."**

A new s...</description>

            <description>Look at the mirror again.

Go ahead. Look.

The person staring back is not you.

Or rather — they ARE you. But not the you from this morning. Not the you from yesterday.

This version of you has answe...</description>

            <link>https://soulfra.com/blog/posts/soulfra-experiment-ch3-the-question.html</link>
            <description>The screen flickers.

For a moment — just a fraction of a second — you see code. Raw text. Scrolling faster than you can read.

Then it's gone.

The next question appears, but something is wrong.

            <description>The wall dissolves.

Not all at once — it happens in sections, like a photograph slowly revealing itself.

When your vision clears, you see three other rooms. Identical to yours. White. Sterile. Empty...</description>

            <description>You open your eyes.

The room is white. Completely white. Walls, floor, ceiling — all the same sterile brightness.

A voice speaks. It's neither male nor female, neither human nor machine:

**"You vol...</description>
